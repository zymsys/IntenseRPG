#The Intense RPG

##How it Works
A role playing game is about making up an adventure story with your friends. One person in your group runs the game, and they are called the Story Teller.  Everyone else has a hero in the Story Teller's story, and they are called Players.  Players can control what their hero's want to do, but the Story Teller is always the final word in what actually happens.  For example, a hero might want to draw a square circle but they're not able. One normal six sided die is required to play. These rules are based on a fantasy medieval setting but can easily be adapted to other kinds of stories.

##Intensity Points
Your hero's life energy is measured in Intensity Points.  You start each day with 30.  You use them up by doing difficult things or being injured.  If a hero's intensity drops to zero they fall unconscious.  Hero's don't die unless the Story Teller says so.

##Combat
Adventures often involve fighting with bad guys. Each player and the Story Teller take turns in combat. Players represent their Hero and the Story Teller plays whoever they are fighting. Normally the players go first in any order they like.  If they're surprised then the Story Teller will likely decide to go first. Each turn, you decide who your Hero wants to attack and roll the die to see if you hit them.  If you beat your opponents defense number then you hit them.  A 6 always hits, and a 1 always misses.  Everyone starts with a defense number of 3, but it can change because of armor or skills.  If you hit then your target loses the number of intensity points caused by the attack.  For example, and untrained fighter takes 2 intensity points away.

##Extreme Maneuvers
Players are encouraged to come up with crazy ideas to achieve objectives.  These are called Extreme Maneuvers.  When a player shares an idea for an extreme maneuver with the group, the Story Teller gives it a difficulty from 1 to 6 or just says it isn’t possible.  Once the player knows the difficulty they choose to try it or not.  If they want to try it they roll the die and if they roll higher than the difficulty they've succeeded.  The Extreme Maneuver is worth 5 times the difficulty in Intensity points for success.  If they succeed they win that many points.  If they fail they only lose the difficulty points. Players can only suggest an Extreme Maneuver once per story day.

##Bad Guys & Scary Things
Heroes fight bad guys.  Bad guys can have any number of intensity points and skills - its all up to the Story Teller.  Normal people have 10 intensity points and no Mad or Intense skills.  This is what separates our Heroes from common people.  See Chapter 6 for some ideas to get you started.

##Yer Stuff
Heroes need stuff to do awesome things.  Every hero starts out with 100 coins.  You can use those coins to buy stuff you might need for your adventure.  Here’s a list of some stuff you might need.  Your Story Teller can set prices for other stuff, and different sources might sell for different prices.  Your Story Teller can also make available stuff that isn’t listed here for any number of coins they like.  See Chapter 5 for descriptions.
