#Intense Role Playing Game: Introduction

##What is it?
A role playing game (RPG) is a game in which players take on a role in a story. Someone who we’ll conveniently call a Story Teller tells the story. Players take on roles in the story, and control the intentions of that character. We call these player controlled characters Heroes.

The purpose of this game as opposed to every other RPG out there is to minimize complexity and maximize fun. Every time I considered a rule I asked myself “Will this make the game more fun or less fun”? If rules that would make the game more realistic would take away any of the fun they were scrapped. If a rule didn’t add much fun it was scrapped. So don’t get bent out of shape that I prefer a quiver of unlimited arrows to counting arrows on a character sheet. Counting arrows isn’t fun.

##Where did it come from?
The Scout Troop I help to lead was enjoying a weekend of winter camping, but as sometimes happens at winter camp things became boring on Saturday night around the camp fire. On the spur of the moment I decided to run a simplified “Dungeons & Dragons” game with the youth. They loved it, and asked if we could play again at the next camp.

Eventually we tried again, this time with real Dungeons & Dragons rules. The game didn’t go well. We got too bogged down in rules with so many newcomers to the game, and I hadn’t played real D&D in years. Still, they kept asking for more Dungeons & Dragons.

I got to thinking about why the first game was so great, and why the second wasn’t very good. I thought about the limited resourced at a camp, and the “feel” of a camp fire. I thought that if I could formalize just a few rules, and emphasize story telling then I could recreate the fun of the first game.  I wrote out a couple of pages and we played a short game at another camp.  Success!  I thought it was the best of the three games.

We often joke that things at camp are “In Tents” which sounds like Intense. Since this game was designed with camp atmosphere in mind, I decided to call it the Intense RPG.

The only chapter you actually *need* to play the game is chapter 3: Core Rules. The rest is advice and resources to make the game easier. Chapters are all very short because you should be spending your time playing the game - not reading about it.
