#Chapter 4: Skills

##Duh Skills
Every hero can do these things.  Duh.

###Fight: 2 damage
This is the basic ability everyone has to punch, kick and scratch in a fight.  This can be upgraded to a Mad Skill or if a Hero wants to so something more interesting it should be considered an Extreme Manoeuvre.

###Throw: 1 damage
Throw is really a catch all for any attack which isn't close up. Heroes who don't have the archery / sling skill do 1 point of throw damage if they get a hit with a sling or bow.

###Reading, writing, basic math
Along with the ability for a Hero to pick lint out of their belly buttons, anything this commonly known should be a Duh skill. Unless you *want* your hero to be illiterate or unable to do math.

###Blind fighting (-3 to hit)
You can try to fight in the dark but it isn't easy to hit anything.

##Mad Skills
These took some training; choose 2 for your Hero.

###Fight: 4 damage; +1 to hit
You've spent years training in the arts of busting people up. now you're more likely to hit, and when you do the destruction is greater.

###Double handed weapons: Two attacks per turn
Your Hero can divide their attention between two weapons; one in each hand to get twice the attacks in. Of course targets need to be the same, or at least standing close to each other.

###Archery or Sling: 2 damage; +1 to hit
Your Hero likes to be able to take care of bad guys *before* they get to close for comfort, so they’ve taken the time to learn how to use a bow and arrow and a sling.  Not both at once.

###Defense: Improve your defense by 1 point
Your Hero finds it easier to be awesome when not getting pummeled by bad guys, so they learned how to dodge attacks. 

###Lightning: 2 damage
This is a spell that does damage from a distance. If something other than lightning is more fun for your Hero, and your Story Teller agrees then this could be anything else. Maybe *your* Hero can do 2 damage by shooting lasers from their eyeballs.

###Laying of Hands: Transfer intensity points to another Hero
Your Hero can give their own intensity points to another Hero. This can be **really** handy if that hero is unconscious and you need them to open a jar or something else important.

###Night vision: See in the dark!
This one isn’t learned, but something you can say your Hero was born with. It is here with non-human races in mind, but you can always claim that a human with this is some kind of mutant.

###Epic Intensity
Your hero starts each day with 40 intensity points instead of 30. Also, Heroes with this skill look like they’re paying attention even when they’re daydreaming.

###Stealth
Your Hero can move silently and hide in shadows. Your Story Teller will assign a difficulty of 1-6 which you have to beat with a roll of the die.

###Extreme Maneuvers
Your Hero makes the impossible look easy. One point bonus against difficulty for Extreme Maneuvers.

###Telepathy
Your Hero was born with the ability to send their speech into other people’s heads without actually speaking. The Here needs to know exactly where the person is, and this doesn’t allow them to read minds. 

In this kind of game, sometimes the Heroes are out of each other’s earshot, but players forget this and act as though they could hear what was going on. The purpose of this skill is really to make it ok for Heroes with the skill to communicate as freely as the players can. Your Story Teller may choose to give all the Heroes this skill as a bonus for convenience.

##Intense Skills
These use up intensity points; choose 2 for your Hero

###Fury: Costs 1 intensity point to do +4 damage
Your Hero can fly into a rage which makes whatever they do in damage to bad guys nastier. This can be used with anything that causes damage including spells.

###Fireball: Costs 1 intensity point to do 8 damage
This is a spell that does 8 damage from a distance. Like lightning it doesn’t have to be a fireball - perhaps your Hero causes canon balls to magically appear over your opponents head, fall on them, and then disappear.

###Rogue Skills (pick pocket, set trap) Costs 1 intensity point
Your Story Teller will assign a difficulty of 1-6 which you have to beat with a roll of the die.
