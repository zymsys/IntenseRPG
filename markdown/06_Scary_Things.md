#Chapter 6: Scary Things

The Story Teller can create any kind of creature they can imagine, but here are a few to help you to get started.

##Furry
Intensity Points: 10;
Defense Points: 2;
Damage: 4

Large furry balls of ferocity which live underground and attack those who trespass in their tunnels. Fur, teeth fangs and piercing eyes are the essence of the Furry.

##Giant Bat
Intensity Points: 10;
Defense Points: 5;
Damage: 5

A large flying rat with leathery wings that swoops down and attacks people’s heads.  These creatures are hard to hit because of their high maneuverability and high speeds. 

##Zombies
Intensity Points: 3;
Defense Points: 1;
Damage: 2

An undead walking corpse that will eat you if not killed.  They tend to travel in large groups. If a Hero’s character drops to zero intensity points at the hands of a zombie they may themselves become a zombie. If this happens then the Story Teller should strongly consider allowing the player to control their own “Zombie Hero” as at least somewhat friendly to the other Heroes, and provide a story which leads to a cure.

##Vampires
Intensity Points: 50;
Defense Points: 3;
Damage: 10

An undead person who has large fangs to drink your blood. These parish quickly in daylight, or if stabbed through the heart with a wooden stake. Story Tellers may introduce other aspects of the Vampire myths as they please.

##Skeletons
Intensity Points: 5;
Defense Points: 3;
Damage: 2

The bones of the dead have been re-animated, and they’re not in a good mood. Fortunately for the Heroes old bones are brittle and shatter easily.
