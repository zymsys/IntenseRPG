#Chapter 1: Player’s Notes

You’re about to play the part of a hero in a story never before told. Not even the Story Teller knows how the story will unfold because they don’t know what your hero will do.

Your hero can be anything you can imagine so long as the Story Teller allows it.  The rules leave out the details so that you can fill them in however you like. You don’t have to choose a particular race or type of character to get the bonus you want. Just add your imagination to the few rules offered.

The same goes for equipment - technically called “Yer Stuff” in this game. Instead of having 20 kinds of swords, there are just regular swords and awesome swords. Awesome swords cost more and do more damage. If you want to call it a "Gnomish Sword of Beastie Slaying" that's up to you.

##How to Be Awesome
The purpose of the game is to have fun by making up a story. You aren’t trying to win against the other players. It might feel like you’re playing against the Story Teller, but they’re trying to provide just the right amount of challenge to make things interesting.

You will find that you work together best when you get into the habit of saying “Yes” to other player’s ideas, and of building on those ideas. Time spent arguing over who’s idea is best can be better spent going ahead with the bad idea and then getting out of the trouble that came from choosing it.

Another key to being awesome at this game is to always look for ways to make other players look good. When you do this everyone has more fun and you’ll be surprised what the other players will do for you.
