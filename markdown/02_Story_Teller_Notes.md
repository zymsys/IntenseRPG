#Chapter 2: Story Teller’s Notes
Being the Story Teller is a tough job. It requires a lot of imagination and quick thinking. Remember that your task is to challenge the players and help them to work together to have fun. You have all the power in the game - what you say goes, even if it goes against the rules as they are written.

The most important advice given to players is to develop the habit of saying “Yes” to ideas and then build on them. The same advice goes for Story Tellers. When a player asks you if they can do something, try to find a way to say “Of course you can” or “That’s brilliant! Go for it!”

Also watch for story ideas from the players. You might have decided that Larry from the General Store was the mastermind behind the mystery the players are trying to solve. When they investigate Larry they think that he reports to another mysterious figure. Fantastic! Go with it and watch the story grow into something better than you would have come up with alone.

##Great Stories
The Story starts with you, but comes to life with the actions of the players. You don’t have to provide a whole lot to get the ball rolling. With a little luck and gentle guidance it will take on a life of its own. An easy way to get started is to roll for a few ideas listed below and then flesh them out. These ideas are broken down into three categories.

##The Hook
The first is called “The Hook”. This is what draws the players into the story - why they want to get involved. Hopefully your players are smart enough to go along with your hook and start the story. If they resist you can try another hook, or you can see if they find their own hook. Sometimes they take a detail you didn’t think was important and latch onto it. Roll with that if you can and spin it into the hook. If all else fails you’ll have to either give up or beg. Explain the concept of working together to make a story and ask them to accept your hook.

Here are some hook ideas you can use to get started. There are six so that you can roll one to get a random hook to start a game quickly.

1. Friend is in Trouble
2. Survival
3. Promise of Glory
4. Mystery
5. New Power
6. Earn a Favour

###Friend is in Trouble
A friend of the Heroes has come to them in need. They don’t know anyone else awesome enough to help them with this, and they’re in *big* trouble.

###Survival
Something bad has happened to your Heroes, and now their survival is at stake. Maybe one of them was bitten by something and finding the anecdote is a big deal. Maybe they were hiking through the forest and all fell down a sink-hole with no clear way back out again. Maybe they’re being threatened by someone even more powerful than they are.

###Promise of Glory
The keys to the city? Name my first born after you? The bards will sing of your glory for centuries? A statue of you in the town square?

###Mystery
This could be an old fashioned murder or theft. It could also be something strange the Heroes see like a pillar of flames shooting out of a mountain or a frog shaped cloud that doesn't move with the other clouds.

###New Power
Heroes can quest to find something that grants them a new skill or bonus. they could be hunting for a secret training ground, a wise hermit, a magic fig bush or anything you like.

###Earn a Favour
A powerful person or organization needs our Heroes for something. If they succeed they'll be owed a huge favour.

##The Objective
After finding a way to get the Heroes interested in the story you need to give them a monumental task. This might be for someone as suggested by the hook. Here are a few ideas to get you started.

1. Rescue
2. Bounty Hunter
3. Treasure
4. Secret Information
5. Freedom
6. Protect Something

###Rescue
A good old fashioned rescue mission. This could be a maiden in distress or something more interesting, like the Captain of the Guard is in trouble, but nobody can know to save embarrassment.

###Bounty Hunter
There’s a fugitive on the run, and the Heroes need to bring them in. This doesn’t have to be literally a criminal on the run. It could be a family member who doesn’t want to be found by the rest of the family, or a business associate on the run from their obligations.

###Treasure
The recovery of treasure is an old stand-by. It could be something needed by someone else inspired by the hook. Think of the old stories where the Heroes have to save the orphanage by raising funds to pay the bank. Of course Heroes should be able to pick up some loot regardless of the story’s objective, and even if the main treasure is for someone else.

###Secret Information
This can work as part of a larger story arc which can span more than one adventure when the information is for the Heroes. More likely the secret information is needed by someone else suggested by the hook.

###Freedom
One or more of the Heroes has lost their freedom for some reason, and something needs to be done to win it back. They may have been captured by slave traders, or arrested for a crime they didn’t commit. They could also have lost their freedom by finding themselves in a huge debt to someone. This could be a story of escape or it could be the motive to do some monumental task for their release.

###Protect Something
The Heroes might have to defend a building or a town from attack. They might need to protect an endangered species from poachers or some other kind of environmental concern. This could also refer to someone’s honour or reputation.

##The Twist
The best stories are more interesting than a simple mission accomplished. Adding a plot twist can make the story a lot more fun to play. Here’s a few plot twists you can throw into your stories towards the end. It’s a good idea to have a plot twist in mind from the start so that you can set up the story to support it when it is discovered by the players. Here are a few ideas:

1. Good guy is bad
2. Item is cursed
3. Dilemma
4. Red Herring
5. Fool's Gold
6. Bad guy is good

###Good guy is bad
The main “Good Guy” in the story other than the Heroes themselves turns out to have different motives than the Heroes had thought and actually has an evil intent.

###Item is cursed
A key item in the story has a curse on it which the Heroes weren’t aware of. Once the curse transfers to the Hero or Heroes it should be difficult to get rid of. This could be something fun. Maybe the Hero’s skin changes color. Maybe they’re no longer capable of lying. Maybe they’re forced to believe anything anyone tells them. It could also be something basic like a penalty on rolls to hit in combat.

###Dilemma
A dilemma is when the Heroes are presented with a situation where they have to choose one thing or another but they can’t have both. For example, maybe they have to move quickly for a rescue to succeed and can’t take time to pick up treasure. Maybe they choose the treasure and the rescue fails! Maybe there is a moral dilemma. Should they give the secret information to the mayor as agreed, or will that information give the mayor a dangerous amount of power and be bad for the townsfolk?

###Red Herring
This one is a bit of a dirty trick to play on the Heroes. All details seem important in a story. You can add some details that don’t really have anything to do with the story and the Heroes will be diverted from their true goal trying to figure out what is important about them. Be careful not to let this one get out of hand. A little red herring can add to the fun, but a huge waist of time is just annoying. Maybe on the way back from rescuing the Captain of the Guard he absolutely has to make a one day stop in the Town of Agedwood because they have the coolest looking bracers there which would look awesome with his armour.

###Fool's Gold
What appears to be valuable to the Heroes isn’t really valuable. Maybe the cloak of invisibility falls to shreds the first time they use it - or maybe only when they’re counting on it. Maybe the huge ruby is really just cut glass.

###Bad guy is good
The person the Heroes have been fighting against the whole time has been misunderstood. They’re actually good guys and they need the Heroes’ help. Can the Heroes be convinced? For example, the Heroes are on a rescue mission but it turns out that they’re rescuing someone who is being held for protection. Maybe whoever coaxed them to take on the mission is trying to get at the person being protected, or maybe they’ve been tricked themselves.
