#Chapter 5: Yer Stuff

The numbers in these lists are the standard price in coins for the item.

##Weapons
The names of these weapons can be changed to suit your Hero.  Daggers and swords are for fighting up close. Bows and slings are for fighting from a distance. More expensive weapons do more damage.

Damage is based on your skill plus the weapon's bonus. Daggers and swords use the fighting skill. Bows and slings use the throw, archery or slingshot skills.

Arrows and sling stones are unlimited because counting how many you have left sucks the fun out of the game.

* 10	Dagger (+1 damage)	
* 20	Sword (+2 damage)	
* 30	Awesome Dagger (+3 damage)	
* 50	Awesome Sword (+4 damage)	
* 20	Bow or Sling

The uncool and cool looking outfits are really just for fun. You can assume that Heroes already have basic rag clothing.

* 40	Armor +1 defense
